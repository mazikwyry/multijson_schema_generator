I have an idea that is simple and easy to administer.  Instead of focusing on using a volatile crypto (SC) to fund projects we could encourage projects to offer rewards in SC to community members that backed their project.  In order for this to work we would need to create a community culture that is biased towards financially supporting projects that offer a decent SC reward. Imagine projects having a far greater chance of getting funded if they offer a 10% SC reward (something like 10 cents worth of SC for every dollar a backer contributes). The project lister would be trusted to send out SC to backers addresses (posted in project comments section by backers) at the close of a successful funding and if they did not it would obviously hurt their reputation. Obviously if the project lister needs to raise $100 they should ask for $110 to cover reward plus project funds. Although it may be encouraged by the community to favor projects that can show they have the coin beforehand.  \n\nThe more strongly we assert this community culture and be supportive and consistent in funding projects that offer SC rewards the more evident the utility of SC will be!  In addition to creating SC utility we increase transaction volume and get newbies to download a wallet and obtain a few SC.  Assuming the platform is a success, future “would be” entrepreneurs might see it wise to hold a little SC so they can be ready to list a project in the future.  As the price of SC rises to more respectable levels (could we see $0.05 again?) those of us with lots of coin will find it easy to fund projects by donating directly or by converting a small amount of SC to donate but until then we would need bitcoin or paypal or some other means of backing projects (so it would not make sense to integrate currently worthless SC absent other payment methods).  Lastly, I think the simplest and most beneficial thing to do with the premine would be to BURN IT.  For these ideas to be effective, however, would require the community to undertake a serious attitude adjustment. Or maybe I am violating some law of economics I am unaware of and it would not work....What do you think?","pinned":false,"edited_message":null,"activity_id":null,"edited_by_admin_at":null,"edited_by_user_at":null,"deleted_by_admin_at":null,"deleted_by_user_at":null,"created_at":"2017-03-15T06:45:48.494Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T06:45:48.494Z","comments_count":0,"likes_count":0,"liked":false,"activitable_type":null,"last_comments":null,"images":[],"activitable":null},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"id":18945,"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Tom","username":"tundra","avatar":{"avatar":{"url":"https://dbstartjoin201601.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/profile/avatar/18929/405080c16c616b3633ccbf7c3f0ed9e8.jpg","large":{"url":"https://dbstartjoin201601.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/profile/avatar/18929/large_405080c16c616b3633ccbf7c3f0ed9e8.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"https://dbstartjoin201601.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/profile/avatar/18929/thumb_405080c16c616b3633ccbf7c3f0ed9e8.jpg"}}},"slug":"tundra"}},"activitable":{"data":null},"parent_activity":{"data":null}}},{"id":"610","type":"posts","attributes":{"type":"Post","message":"Hi I do have some questions regarding the transfer of startcoin ownership to the community.

They are underwritten in many cases by bankrupt financial institutions which are only still in existence today due to the extreme emergency measures undertaken by governments around the world to keep them alive on life-support at the expense of society as a whole.

They are squandering the prosperity of future generations. And society continues to permit this recklessness by spending and receiving payments in government issued fiat currency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe instability in the economy is reaching critical levels, and the amount of systemic risk within the system is reaching such extremes that a catastrophic failure is at this point, a mathematical certainty. It is astounding that a system so broken and harmful to society has been able to continue for so long. Reality will soon sink in, but for most people, it is already too late to prepare for the inevitable disaster that is waiting just around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrecious metals remain the ultimate \"safe-haven\" asset and the recent flurry of innovation that is taking place in the cryptocurrency world is progressing at an alarmingly rapid pace. These two assets together offer us our best hope to escape the coming disaster unharmed, or to potentially even benefit from the biggest transfer of wealth that will ever occur in your lifetime. Cryptobullion gives investors a way to gain exposure to both the precious metals market and the cryptocurrency market simultaneously. Positioning yourself in these markets now, in advance of any banking failure, will allow you to gain maximum benefit from the wealth transfer that is about to occur from those remaining invested in a “paper ponzi” financial asset market to those invested in “sound money” and REAL, tangible assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCryptobullion gives people an easy way to obtain a REAL asset with REAL intrinsic value. Cryptobullion has ZERO counterparty risk, so there is no potential risk in losing everything because of the incompetence of Bank CEO’s and Politicians. It also has allodial title, meaning that if you hold it in your hand, it legally belongs to you and nobody can take it away from you without your consent. They cannot seize your capital or freeze any transactions you make with cryptocurrency because of capital controls, or impose upon you immoral and unjustifiable negative interest rates whereby you get CHARGED for the benefit of handing over your money to the banks to gamble with on their casino platforms.

Hard currency such as Gold and Silver are often referred to as \"honest money\" as they can ensure fairness for all parties involved in an exchange of value, without the need for a trusted third party to arbitrate the process. This proven historical track record has firmly established Precious Metals as the most reliable known monetary basis upon which to operate a stable, free-market system of economics, particularly over long periods of time and across international borders. The reason is because these metals are rare earth elements with certain unique physical and chemical properties that make them particularly suited to the important role of acting as a monetary instrument.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany other physical commodities such as tobacco, cattle, grain, salt, tea, pearls and oil have been used as \"hard currency\" with which to facilitate trade. Commodities are a useful form of currency as they have \"intrinsic value\" which can be independently determined by anyone. In other words, they have value not because of a promise or guarantee from a third party, but because they are rare or otherwise scarce items, have unique or useful properties that make them in-demand by a large number of people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese properties include:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScarcity \u003c/strong\u003e- being naturally limited by the constraints of the planets resources, physical commodities cannot be created “ex-nihilo\" or rather, out of thin air. They are useful as currency because the supply is naturally limited, either because of high production costs or rarity. If it was possible to produce an unlimited amount of the item at little or no cost, then it would ultimately be deemed useless as a currency and unfit for purpose. The outcome in a free-market would be a rapid market devaluation until the currency had zero purchasing power remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllodial title \u003c/strong\u003e- meaning ownership is implied by possession of the object. If you possess the asset then you hold the legal title to the property and are the legal owner. This is a necessary property of any currency as ownership must be quickly and easily transferrable. Assets like land, cars or real-estate are not useful as currency as title to these assets must be transferred through a third party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntrinsic value\u003c/strong\u003e - commodities have intrinsic value that is inherent to its utility in daily life. This is compared to an asset that has value only because of the promises or guarantees offered by third-parties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eZero counterparty risk\u003c/strong\u003e - meaning the value of a the object is not dependent on the good-standing of a third-party and there is no risk of it becoming immediately worthless should that party default on their obligations. Assets with zero counterparty risk are not simultaneously someone else’s liability - e.g. stocks, bonds, derivatives and fiat currencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile most commodities can be considered forms of “hard currency” and can be used to facilitate trade, the majority are either unreliable or impractical for use as money in day to day trade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSound money must have the following properties to be considered a dependable monetary instrument.

When systemic risk is permitted to pile up over many decades to reach highly dangerous and unstable levels, a cascading failure of the banking and monetary system is not just a possibility, it is a mathematical certainty. When this inevitable outcome finally occurs, it will come as a surprise to the majority of those who have repeatedly failed to heed the warnings or inform themselves of the reality of the situation our Western Economies now appear to be facing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSystemic failure will will cause widespread and devastating destruction of wealth and precipitate a rapid flight of capital en-masse out of all financial asset classes (derivatives, bonds, stocks, fiat currencies etc) in search of safety.

It is the expression of pent-up mistrust of and frustration with the existing global banking and financial systems. In addition, it represents the emergence of a \"global insurrection against banker occupation” and a social paradigm shift away from the catastrophic Keynesian economic models that have brought the global economy to breaking point, and away from assets with uncertain levels of counterparty risk, encouraging those who are liberty-minded towards an economy that is free of excessive levels of debt and instead founded on a sound monetary platform that encourages savings and and prudent financial behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStartCOIN is an example of a sound digital currency that has a limited, finite supply known by all market participants. Cryptocurrency shares many of the properties that give silver and gold their use as money, while dramatically improving on others. This is not by coincidence, it is by design. The process through which new supply is created is a decreasing exponential function, mathematically modelled on the process of mining gold. This ensures a theoretical finite supply, which becomes progressively more difficult and expensive to create over time. However, while it fulfils most of the criteria of sound money, it has yet to prove itself as a reliable store of value over time. Prices in the cryptocurrency markets have been highly volatile while in their early stages, but this represents a truly free market with natural price discovery processes that are not impeded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile cryptocurrency has huge benefits over existing monetary instruments, some argue it has no intrinsic value, while others argue that it has intrinsic value due to the fact it permits instant, global, peer-peer frictionless payments at almost no cost whatsoever. Its use as a currency is growing, but silver has a proven track record in it’s use as a store of value over time. Combining the properties of both of these assets into a Cryptobullion round gives investors the best of both worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStartCOIN Cryptobullion Design Specifications\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe silver round will be 1.5 inches in diameter.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt will have a silver content of exactly 1 troy oz of 999+ fineness.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt will contain 50 StartCOIN stored on a private key printed on a 0.5 inch disc behind a security hologram of 1 inch diameter.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe front of the security hologram will display the full address associated with the hidden private key so that the balance can be verified on the blockchain.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIndividual rounds will come in a protective transparent coin-capsule.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMultiples of 20 will come in airtight mint tubes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAvailable Payment Methods\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBackers may pledge directly to the\nproject in either StartCOIN or Bitcoin (once the project has reached its goal)\n\u003cp\u003eUsers can also buy StartCOIN and bitcoin\nusing \u003ca href=\"https://bittylicious.com/coin/START\"\u003ebittylicious.com\u003c/a\u003e or\ntrader their altcoins for StartCOIN at the \u003ca href=\"https://bittrex.com/\"\u003ebittrex\u003c/a\u003e exchange\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePayments to bitcoin addresses can also\nbe made with other alt coins, via 3rd party payment processors such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.coingateway.net/\"\u003ecoingateway.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaypal will NOT be available as a\npayment option on this campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll pledges are final once payment has\nbeen sent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDispatch and Delivery\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf the project reaches its target funding goal, estimated date of dispatch is January 2015.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlease ensure you provide a valid dispatch address to ensure no problems with delivery arise.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDelivery will be via Standard Registered mail at receivers risk.
